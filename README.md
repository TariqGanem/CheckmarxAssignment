## Hi and welcome to the Checkmarx home assignment solution.

#### 1. I've added Part 1 here as well as Part 2.
#### 2. Attached is also, a class diagram representing the code and the abstraction of the design.
#### 3. Regarding Part 1, I didn't have enough time to write down the pre/post conditions for each test scenario.

### Hope you find this good enough :)
